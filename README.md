This project was created as an excercise in plain javascript using ES6 concepts such as classes and async/await and is loosely based on [Complete Intro to Web Development v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/word-game-project-demo/) by Brian Holt. It currently relies on 3 free APIs:
